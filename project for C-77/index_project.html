        <h3>What is the console screen?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The console screen is a window that shows us what all the computer is processing while the code runs. It helps the person to spot mistakes and confirm the code. One can access it by right clicking on the screen and selecting the inspect option and then choosing the console option.</p>

            console.log(first_name);

            var last_name="Singhal"
            console.log(last_name);

            var full_name=first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var no1=102
            console.log(no1);

            var no2=3
            console.log(no2);

            console.log(no1 + no2);
            console.log(no1 - no2);
